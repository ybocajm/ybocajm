- 👋 Hi, I’m @ybocajm --- I recently began learning on Treehouse.  I'm ybocajm (EmJay) on twitter.  I have 1 dev friend on Discord.  I recently registered for showwcase.  If you are reading this, learning Python, and want to collaborate on any projects, please reach out.
- 👀 These days I'm pretty focused on learning Python.    
- 🌱 While loops - and other such concepts - are becoming understandable.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Python projects.
- 📫 I am trying to get better at understanding how all the basic components of Python come together in a practical sense.  Everyone talks about how useful Python is, but the learning I've done so far doesn't really show me how it's used in the workplace.  Treehouse sort of tapped into that, which was really helpful.  Atop learning, I want more contacts in the coding world.  Maybe someone can help give me a line on a Jr Programming position.
